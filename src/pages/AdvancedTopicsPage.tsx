            Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines reinforcement learning with deep learning, using neural
            networks to approximate value functions, policies, or models. This integration allows RL to scale to
            problems with high-dimensional state spaces that were previously intractable.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            DQN was one of the first successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, using a deep neural network
            to approximate the Q-function. Key innovations in DQN include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Experience replay:</strong> Storing and randomly sampling transitions to break correlations in the training data</li>
            <li><strong>Target networks:</strong> Using a separate network for generating targets to stabilize training</li>
            <li><strong>Reward clipping:</strong> Limiting rewards to a fixed range to improve stability</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">DQN Variants and Improvements</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Several enhancements to DQN have been developed:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Double DQN:</strong> Addresses overestimation bias by using separate networks for action selection and evaluation</li>
            <li><strong>Dueling DQN:</strong> Separates the value and advantage functions for better learning efficiency</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritized Experience Replay:</strong> Samples important transitions more frequently based on TD error</li>
            <li><strong>Noisy Networks:</strong> Adds parameter noise for more structured exploration</li>
            <li><strong>Distributional RL:</strong> Models the distribution of returns rather than just the expected value</li>

            <p className="mb-4">
              DeepMind's AlphaGo combined deep reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo tree search to defeat world
              champion Go players, a feat previously thought to be decades away. The subsequent AlphaZero algorithm
              learned to play Go, chess, and shogi at superhuman levels through pure self-play, without any human
              knowledge beyond the rules of the games.

        <ContentBlock>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Policy gradient methods directly optimize the policy without necessarily learning a value function.
            They're particularly useful for continuous action spaces and problems where the optimal policy is stochastic.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Advantages of Policy Gradient Methods</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Natural for continuous action spaces</li>
            <li>Can learn stochastic policies, which may be optimal in some environments</li>
            <li>Often have better convergence properties than value-based methods</li>
            <li>Can incorporate domain-specific constraints or structure into the policy</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            TRPO and PPO are policy optimization methods that aim to make safe, reliable updates by constraining
            how much the policy can change in a single step:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>TRPO:</strong> Uses a constraint on the KL divergence between old and new policies to ensure small, safe updates</li>
            <li><strong>PPO:</strong> Simplifies TRPO by using a clipped objective function to discourage large policy changes</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These methods have become popular due to their stability, sample efficiency, and strong performance
            across a wide range of tasks.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            SAC is an off-policy actor-critic method that incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Maximizes both expected return and entropy (randomness) in the policy</li>
            <li>Works well in continuous action spaces</li>
            <li>Achieves good sample efficiency due to its off-policy nature</li>
            <li>Automatically balances exploration and exploitation</li>

        <ContentBlock>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The exploration-exploitation dilemma is a core challenge in reinforcement learning: an agent must
            balance exploring new actions to discover potentially better strategies with exploiting known
            good actions to maximize reward.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Multi-armed bandit problems are a simplified reinforcement learning setting where the agent
            repeatedly chooses between several actions (arms of the bandit) and receives a reward, with no
            state transitions. Several algorithms have been developed for this setting:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>ε-greedy:</strong> Choose the best-known action with probability 1-ε, and a random action with probability ε</li>
            <li><strong>Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):</strong> Select actions based on their potential upside, accounting for uncertainty</li>
            <li><strong>Thompson Sampling:</strong> Sample from a posterior distribution over rewards and choose the action with the highest sample</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Intrinsic Motivation and Curiosity</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Intrinsic motivation methods provide additional rewards to encourage exploration of novel or uncertain states:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Count-based exploration:</strong> Reward visiting states that have been seen less frequently</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction error:</strong> Reward states where the agent's model of the environment has high prediction error</li>
            <li><strong>Random Network Distillation:</strong> Use the error in predicting the output of a random fixed network as a novelty signal</li>
            <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Reward states that maximize the agent's control over the environment</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Information-Theoretic Approaches</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Information theory provides a framework for understanding exploration as information gain:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Maximum Entropy RL:</strong> Add an entropy bonus to encourage diverse behaviors</li>
            <li><strong>Information gain:</strong> Select actions that maximize expected information gain about the environment</li>
            <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Measure the agent's ability to influence its future states (mutual information between actions and future states)</li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Non-stationarity: Each agent's optimal policy depends on other agents' policies, which are changing</li>

            <li>Competition vs. cooperation: Different reward structures lead to different interaction patterns</li>
            <li>Emergent behaviors: Complex behaviors can emerge from simple local interactions</li>
